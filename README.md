# University Course Registration System

A university wants to develop a Course Registration System to manage student enrollments, courses, and faculty. The system should allow students to register for courses, track their progress, and allow faculty members to manage course content and student grades. Your task is to design and implement the database for this system, covering all steps from entity modeling to SQL table creation.
